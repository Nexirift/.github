# Nexirift Open Source
Welcome to the Nexirift organization on GitHub!

We are an upcoming social networking platform, dedicated to connecting people and fostering meaningful interactions. Our open-source projects are designed to empower developers like you to contribute and shape the future of our platform.

Whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting out, we invite you to explore our repositories, join our community, and make a positive impact on the Nexirift platform.

Happy coding!

## Repositories
As part of our dedication to transparency, most of our repositories are open source. Feel free to browse through the code, contribute, and help us improve!

### API Server
Our API server is called spark! Currently, we do not have the repository public as we are still developing it.

### Relays
We plan to have relays that connect to Mastodon and Atproto instances. This has not been started yet.

### Authentication
We have made a GraphQL Yoga connector to authenticate users using the open source Keycloak authentication solution.

Visit the repository here: [plugin-keycloak](https://github.com/Nexirift/plugin-keycloak).

### Policies
We are still working on making internal policies public (such as the data breach policy), please check back later.

## Reporting a Security Vulnerability
