# Nexirift Open Source

Welcome to the Nexirift organization on GitHub!

We are an innovative social networking platform dedicated to connecting people and fostering meaningful interactions. Our open-source projects empower developers to contribute and shape the future of our platform.

We welcome developers of all experience levels to explore our repositories, join our community, and make a positive impact on Nexirift.

## Repositories

Most of our repositories are open source as part of our commitment to transparency. We encourage you to explore the code and contribute!

### API Server

Our core API server is [Nova](https://github.com/Nexirift/nova).

### Relays

We are planning to implement relays connecting to the ActivityPub protocol (Mastodon, Pleroma) and ATProto (Bluesky) networks. Development has not yet begun.

### Authentication

Our custom authentication system [Cosmos](https://github.com/Nexirift/cosmos) works together with [plugin-better-auth](https://github.com/Nexirift/plugin-better-auth) to provide user authorization for the [Nova](https://github.com/Nexirift/nova) API server.

Learn more about why we built our own authentication system [here](https://blog.nexirift.com/blog/moving-to-our-own-authentication-server).

### Policies

We are in the process of making our internal policies (including data breach policy) publicly available. Check back soon.

## Documentation

Comprehensive documentation for all our open source repositories is currently in development.
