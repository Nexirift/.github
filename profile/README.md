# Nexirift Open Source

Welcome to the Nexirift organization on GitHub!

We are an upcoming social networking platform, dedicated to connecting people and fostering meaningful interactions. Our open-source projects are designed to empower developers like you to contribute and shape the future of our platform.

Whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting out, we invite you to explore our repositories, join our community, and make a positive impact on the Nexirift platform.

Happy coding!

## Repositories

As part of our dedication to transparency, most of our repositories are open source. Feel free to browse through the code, contribute, and help us improve!

### API Server

Our API server is called [Nova](https://github.com/Nexirift/nova)!

### Relays

We plan to have relays that connect to the Activitypub protocol (Mastodon, Pleroma, etc) and Atproto (Bluesky) instances. This has not been started yet.

### Authentication

We have made a GraphQL Yoga connector to authenticate users using compatible OpenID Connect solutions.

Visit the repository here: [plugin-oidc](https://github.com/Nexirift/plugin-oidc).

### Policies

We are still working on making internal policies public (such as the data breach policy), please check back later.

## Documentation

We are working on providing documentation for all of our open source repositories.

## Reporting a Security Vulnerability
