# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders of Nexirift pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Commit Message Guidelines

## AI Usage Policy

We encourage transparency regarding the use of artificial intelligence in our projects:

* **Review Process**: All AI-generated code must undergo the same review process as human-written code
* **Responsibility**: Contributors remain fully responsible for any AI-assisted code they submit, including its correctness, security, and compliance with project standards
* **Learning**: We require contributors to understand and be able to explain any AI-generated code they submit

## Project-Specific Guidelines

### Cosmos (Authentication Server)
* Security is paramount - all authentication-related code requires thorough review
* Follow secure coding practices and OWASP guidelines
* Document any security considerations in pull requests

### plugin-better-auth (GraphQL Yoga Bridge)
* Maintain compatibility with both better-auth and GraphQL Yoga APIs
* Provide clear examples and documentation for integration
* Test thoroughly against multiple versions of dependencies

### Nova (Core API Server)
* Adhere to the Nexirift social platform specification

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.
